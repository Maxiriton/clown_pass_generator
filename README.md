# Clown Pass Generator

Easily add a clown pass to your current scene. If you are into old school compositing or are forced to use the Adobe Suite and can't install the cryptomatte plugin, this might help you ! 
This addon can generate two types of clown passes, material and objects.

## Clown pass for objects in scene

## Usage

To add the clown pass, simply click on the Object Menu in Object Mode and click on the ==Generate Clown Pass== button. You can adjust some parameters in the last operator panel in the bottom left corner of the 3D view. And that's it you now have a clown pass added to your render.
